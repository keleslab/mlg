\title{This function takes a list of low dimensional embedding data as input, construct a SNN graph for each low dimensional embeddings, and then plot a heatmap of the proportion of overlapping edges between each pair of SNN graphs.}
\usage{
prop.overlap.edges(factor.list, knn.param = 20, prune.param = 1/5)
}
\arguments{
\item{factor.list}{A list that contains several low dimensional embedding data.}

\item{knn.param}{The number of neighbors used to construct k-nearest-neighbot graph.}

\item{prune.param}{The prune parameter for SNN graph. There is an edge between cell i and j in the SNN graph, if the number of common neighbors between i and j exceeds the product of knn.param and knn.param.}
}
\value{
A heatmap of the proportion of overlapping edges between each pair of SNN graphs constructed from low dimension embeddings.
}
